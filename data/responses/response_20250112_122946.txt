RESPONSE:
COORDINATES: 1300, 1415
EXPLANATION: To locate the Google Chrome icon, I first focused my search on the taskbar area, which is typically located around Y=1415 based on the coordinate system. Scanning along this row, I spotted a circular icon with the distinctive red, yellow, green, and blue segments that match the description of the Chrome icon.

Using the grid overlay, I can determine a precise coordinate. The icon is located just to the right of the major gridline at X=1200. Counting 4 minor gridlines to the right (each representing 25 pixels), I estimate the icon's center is at approximately X=1300.

So in summary, the Google Chrome icon can be found on the taskbar at the coordinates 1300, 1415. The multi-colored circular logo is a clear match to Chrome's iconic design.
