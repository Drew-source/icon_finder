RESPONSE:
Let me help find the Windows File Explorer icon by following a systematic approach.

```
COORDINATES: 220, 1415
EXPLANATION:

1. Initial Grid Analysis:
- Looking at the taskbar area (Y â‰ˆ 1415 as per common locations)
- Scanning from left to right along the taskbar

2. Icon Identification:
- Located the File Explorer icon in the taskbar
- It's positioned near the start of the taskbar
- Identified by its distinctive yellow folder icon

3. Precise Coordinate Measurement:
X coordinate:
- Icon is in the third major column (200-299 range)
- Approximately 20 pixels into that column
- Therefore X = 220

Y coordinate:
- Located on taskbar
- Standard taskbar Y position is 1415
- Confirmed by grid overlay

4. Validation:
- Position matches common taskbar location
- Coordinates fall within screen bounds (0-2560, 0-1440)
- Icon matches Windows File Explorer appearance
- Location makes sense for default Windows taskbar layout

The coordinates 220, 1415 should click directly on the File Explorer icon in the taskbar.
