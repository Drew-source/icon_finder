RESPONSE:
```
COORDINATES: 225, 1415
EXPLANATION:
1. First, I located the taskbar at the bottom of the screen (Y â‰ˆ 1415)

2. Looking along the taskbar, I identified the Google Chrome icon by its distinctive circular shape and blue/red/yellow/green colors

3. The Chrome icon appears in the taskbar between the 200 and 300 pixel gridlines:
- Starting from left edge (X=0)
- Counting grid lines: 2 full lines + ~25 pixels
- Therefore X = 225

4. Verification steps:
- Icon is in expected taskbar location (Y=1415)
- X coordinate falls within typical taskbar app range
- Visual confirmation of Chrome's distinctive icon design
- Position matches common taskbar icon placement

5. Final coordinates:
X = 225 (2 grid lines + 25px)
Y = 1415 (taskbar height)
