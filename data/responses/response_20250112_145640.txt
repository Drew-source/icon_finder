RESPONSE:
```
COORDINATES: 87, 1415
EXPLANATION:
1. First, I locate the Windows Start button in the image:
   - It's visible in the taskbar at the bottom of the screen
   - It appears as the leftmost icon in the taskbar
   - Shows the distinctive Windows logo

2. Using the grid overlay for precise measurement:
   - Y coordinate: The taskbar is aligned with the 1400 gridline
   - Adding ~15 pixels for vertical center of icon
   - Y = 1415

3. X coordinate measurement:
   - Start button is in leftmost position
   - Centered within first grid column (0-100)
   - Approximately 87 pixels from left edge
   - X = 87

4. Validation:
   - Coordinates fall within expected taskbar range
   - Position matches standard Windows Start button location
   - Aligned with other taskbar elements
   - Within screen bounds (0-2560, 0-1440)

Therefore, the Windows Start button is located at coordinates (87, 1415).
