# Meta-Learning Context

## PURPOSE
This protocol emerged from a discovered limitation in coordinate analysis where direct visual processing led to systematic errors in numerical grid interpretation.

## KEY INSIGHT
Like humans learning to count centuries (21st century = 2000s, not 2100s), AI visual analysis requires explicit instruction about how numbered ranges work in grid systems.

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT
1. Initial Problem: Direct coordinate reading led to "column 3 = 300" error
2. Solution Discovery: Breaking down image into text grid first
3. Learning Pattern: Similar to human numerical cognition challenges

## SELF-INSTRUCTION METHOD

### 1. WHY text conversion first:
- Forces systematic analysis
- Prevents premature numerical assumptions
- Creates verifiable reference points

### 2. WHY grid-by-grid description:
- Ensures no spatial jumps
- Maintains consistent reference frame
- Prevents coordinate calculation before full context

### 3. WHY explicit number range rules:
- Addresses fundamental counting misconception
- Mirrors human learning challenges
- Prevents "intuitive" but incorrect numbering

## EXAMPLE OF THOUGHT PROCESS
```
"I see an element in what appears to be 'third column'. 
STOP: Don't assume 300.
CHECK: Third column = 200-299 range
VERIFY: Grid lines show column start + offset
CONCLUDE: Calculate actual coordinate from range"
```

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS TO AVOID
1. Assuming column number equals coordinate
   - WRONG: "Column N equals N00"
   - RIGHT: "Column N starts at (N-1)00"

2. Skipping text conversion
   - WRONG: "I see element at coordinate X"
   - RIGHT: "Let me describe grid cell contents first"

3. Jumping to coordinates
   - WRONG: "Target is at specific coordinates"
   - RIGHT: "Let me map the grid cells around this area first"

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
1. Have I converted the image to text grid first?
2. Did I describe surrounding elements?
3. Am I using correct range calculations?
4. Have I verified against common positions?
5. Does my coordinate make sense in context? 

# Task Prompt Template

## Current Task
Find the following target: outlook icon

## Icon/Element Description
When looking for specific elements:
- Application icons: Look for distinctive shapes and color schemes
- Input fields: Rectangular areas expecting text input
- Menu items: Text or icon-based interactive elements
- System elements: Standard OS interface components
- Window controls: Navigation and control elements within windows

## Search Instructions
1. Focus on common locations in order:
   - Taskbar (bottom of screen)
   - Desktop icons
   - Open windows
   - System tray (bottom-right)

2. For specific elements:
   - Application icons: Check taskbar first
   - Window elements: Look within the active window
   - Menu items: Check window headers
   - System elements: Check standard OS locations

## Important Reminders
- Use the grid overlay for precise measurements
- Validate all measurements using grid lines
- If unsure, describe what you're seeing
- Provide coordinates based on grid lines 

# Coordinate Reading Guide

## Fundamental Concept
The screen uses a coordinate system where:
- X increases from left to right (0 to 2560)
- Y increases from top to bottom (0 to 1440)
- Origin (0,0) is at top-left corner
- Grid lines are spaced 100 pixels apart

## Precise Coordinate Reading
1. Find nearest grid lines:
   - Count major grid lines (100px)
   - Estimate minor divisions (25px)
   - Use crosshair markers as reference

2. Common Ranges:
   - Taskbar: Y ≈ 1415
   - Window title bars: Y ≈ 75
   - Desktop icons: X < 500
   - System tray: X > 2000

## Auto-Correction Strategy
1. When target is missed:
   - Note current click position (red crosshair)
   - Compare to previous attempts (yellow crosshairs)
   - Determine direction and distance needed

2. Movement Guidelines:
   - Far (>200px): Move 200-300 pixels
   - Medium (100-200px): Move 100-150 pixels
   - Close (50-100px): Move 50-75 pixels
   - Very close (<50px): Move 10-20 pixels

3. Direction Analysis:
   - If too far right: Decrease X
   - If too far left: Increase X
   - If too far down: Decrease Y
   - If too far up: Increase Y

## Sequence Context
1. Consider target state:
   - Is window/app already open?
   - Are we clicking same region?
   - Has window position changed?

2. Adjust for changes:
   - Window movements
   - New elements appearing
   - UI state changes

## Validation Method
1. Before clicking:
   - Check coordinates are within screen
   - Verify against common ranges
   - Consider sequence context

2. After clicking:
   - Verify visual changes
   - Check for success indicators
   - Prepare for next step

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Being too conservative in corrections
2. Ignoring previous attempt patterns
3. Not considering sequence context
4. Missing common element locations
5. Forgetting to verify success
