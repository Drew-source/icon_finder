RESPONSE:
COORDINATES: 1125, 1415
EXPLANATION: To locate the Chrome icon, I first focused my search on the taskbar area, which is typically located around Y=1415 based on the coordinate guide. Scanning the taskbar from left to right, I spotted a circular icon with the distinctive red, yellow, green, and blue segments that match the description of the Chrome icon.

Using the grid overlay, I counted 11 major grid lines from the left edge to estimate the X-coordinate, and then added about 1/4 of the distance to the next grid line, giving an X-coordinate of approximately 1125. The icon is sitting right on the horizontal grid line at Y=1415, confirming the expected taskbar height.

Therefore, my best estimate for the center coordinates of the Chrome icon is 1125, 1415. The icon's distinctive colors and circular shape, combined with its location on the taskbar, give me high confidence this is the Chrome icon requested in the task prompt.
