RESPONSE:
Let me analyze the image to find Microsoft Edge:

COORDINATES: 220, 1415
EXPLANATION:
1. First, I'll focus on the taskbar area (Y â‰ˆ 1415) since that's a common location for application icons

2. Looking at the taskbar (bottom of screen):
- I can see several icons including Chrome (blue/red/yellow/green circular icon)
- Microsoft Edge icon (blue wave/spiral design) is visible
- It's positioned in the third column from the left

3. Precise coordinate calculation:
- Y coordinate: The taskbar is consistently at Y=1415
- X coordinate: 
  * First grid line starts at 0
  * Second column starts at 100
  * Third column starts at 200
  * The icon appears about 20 pixels into the third column
  * Therefore X = 220

4. Verification:
- Location makes sense for taskbar pinned apps
- Position matches common Windows taskbar layout
- Coordinates fall within expected ranges
- Icon matches Microsoft Edge's distinctive appearance

The coordinates 220, 1415 should place us directly on the Microsoft Edge icon in the taskbar.
