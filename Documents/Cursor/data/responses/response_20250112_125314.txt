RESPONSE:
COORDINATES: 1300, 1415
EXPLANATION: Based on the image and instructions provided, I can see that the target is the Google Chrome icon. Here's how I located it:

1. The GUI initializes successfully each time, as evidenced by the consistent grid overlay and terminal output.

2. The Chrome client is initializing correctly in recent tries, with the icon varying between x=(1300-1350, y=1415). This indicates the Chrome icon is located in the taskbar.

3. There was one earlier outlier attempt located at around (1500, 1300), but more recent attempts have narrowed in on the taskbar location for the Chrome icon.

4. Counting the grid lines, the current red crosshair marker is at exactly (1300, 1415), directly over where I would expect to find the Chrome icon in the Windows taskbar based on the location of previous yellow crosshair attempts.

So in summary, the Chrome icon appears to be located at coordinates (1300, 1415) in the taskbar of the Windows GUI. Let me know if you need any other details!
