RESPONSE:
Let me analyze the image to find the Google Chrome icon:

COORDINATES: 220, 1415

EXPLANATION:
1. First, I looked at the common locations, starting with the taskbar (Y â‰ˆ 1415)
2. Scanning along the taskbar from left to right:
   - Found the Chrome icon in the early section of the taskbar
   - It's positioned in the third major column (200-299 range)
   - Specifically about 20 pixels into that column (220)
3. Verification steps:
   - Confirmed Y coordinate at taskbar height (1415)
   - Verified X coordinate by counting grid lines:
     * First major line at 100
     * Second major line at 200
     * Icon appears ~20 pixels after 200 line
4. Visual confirmation:
   - Identified Chrome's distinctive circular icon with red, yellow, green, and blue segments
   - Position matches expected taskbar pinned apps location
   - Consistent with common Windows taskbar layout

The coordinates 220, 1415 place the click right on the Chrome icon in the taskbar, which is exactly where we want to be for launching Chrome.
