RESPONSE:
I apologize for my previous incorrect coordinate. Let me try again, following the process step-by-step:

1. Convert image to text grid:
   - Taskbar visible at bottom
   - Terminal window open on right side
   - VS Code window open on left side
   - Google Chrome icon visible in taskbar

2. Locate Google Chrome icon in taskbar:
   - Taskbar spans Y=1400 to Y=1440 
   - Chrome icon is 4th from left
   - Each taskbar icon is about 50 pixels wide
   - So Chrome icon starts around X=150

3. Determine precise X-coordinate of Chrome icon:
   - Closest grid line to left of icon is X=100
   - Icon is about halfway between X=100 and X=200
   - Estimating icon center is at X=150

4. Determine precise Y-coordinate of Chrome icon:  
   - Taskbar bottom is at Y=1440
   - Taskbar is about 40 pixels tall
   - So icon vertical center is around Y=1420

5. Final coordinate estimate: 150, 1420

To validate:
- Coordinates are within taskbar range
- X=150 matches expected 4th position 
- Y=1420 is vertically centered in taskbar
- Coordinates are within screen bounds

Therefore, my final answer is:

COORDINATES: 150, 1420
EXPLANATION: The Google Chrome icon is located in the taskbar, 4th from the left. Based on the grid lines, its center appears to be around X=150, halfway between the X=100 and X=200 grid lines. Vertically, the taskbar spans Y=1400 to Y=1440, and the icon is vertically centered within it, so I estimate its Y-coordinate is 1420.
