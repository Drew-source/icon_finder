RESPONSE:
```
COORDINATES: 87, 1415
EXPLANATION:
1. First, I located the taskbar at the bottom of the screen (Y â‰ˆ 1415)

2. Looking for the Windows Start button:
- Checked leftmost position on taskbar
- Found distinctive Windows logo icon
- Located in first column (0-99 range for X)
- Specifically at X=87 based on grid position

3. Verification steps:
- Confirmed standard Windows Start button location (bottom-left)
- Verified against grid overlay
- X coordinate (87) falls within first column (0-99)
- Y coordinate (1415) matches standard taskbar height

4. Additional context:
- Start button is first icon on taskbar
- Shows typical Windows 11 centered taskbar layout
- Other taskbar icons visible to the right
- System tray visible on far right

The coordinates 87,1415 represent the precise center of the Windows Start button icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
