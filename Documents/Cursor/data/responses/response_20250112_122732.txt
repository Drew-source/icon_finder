RESPONSE:
COORDINATES: 100, 1415
EXPLANATION: The Google Chrome icon can be found on the taskbar, which is located at the bottom of the screen. Using the grid overlay, I can see that the taskbar spans the full width of the screen from X=0 to X=2560. The taskbar itself is positioned just above the Y=1400 grid line, so I estimate its Y coordinate to be around 1415.

Looking at the left side of the taskbar, I see several application icons. The first one has the distinctive circular shape and multi-colored segments of the Google Chrome logo. It is positioned very close to the left edge, just to the right of the X=100 grid line.

Therefore, I determine the center point of the Google Chrome icon to be at coordinates X=100, Y=1415. This matches the expected position for commonly used application icons on the Windows taskbar.
