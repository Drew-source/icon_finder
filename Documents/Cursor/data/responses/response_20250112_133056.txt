RESPONSE:
Based on the image, I will convert the relevant portion to a text grid to determine the precise coordinates of the Google Chrome icon on the taskbar.

Text grid:
1400 | taskbar with icons
1500 |
1600 |

The Google Chrome icon, recognizable by its circular shape with red, yellow, green, and blue segments, appears to be the second icon from the left on the taskbar.

To determine the X-coordinate:
- The taskbar spans the full width, so the left edge starts at X=0
- Estimating the icon is about 1/4 of the way across the first major grid column (0-100)
- This puts it around the 25 pixel mark horizontally

For the Y-coordinate:
- The taskbar is at the very bottom of the screen
- The bottom of the screen is at Y=1440 
- Estimating the taskbar is about 25 pixels tall
- This puts the vertical center of the icon at around Y=1415

Therefore, my analysis concludes the center point of the Google Chrome icon is located approximately at:

COORDINATES: 25, 1415

EXPLANATION: I first converted the relevant section to a text grid to systematically analyze the icon's position. Recognizing the Chrome icon visually, I determined it was the second icon from the left on the taskbar. I estimated it was 1/4 of the way across the first 100-pixel column, putting the X-coordinate at around 25. For Y, I knew the taskbar was at the bottom 1440 pixel edge, and estimated it to be vertically centered 25 pixels above that, resulting in a Y-coordinate of 1415. This matches the expected taskbar range of around Y=1415.
