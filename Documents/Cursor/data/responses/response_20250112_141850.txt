RESPONSE:
Let me help locate the Windows Start button.

COORDINATES: 20, 1415

EXPLANATION:
1. First, I'll analyze the taskbar location, which is typically at Y â‰ˆ 1415 (bottom of screen)

2. The Windows Start button is almost always at the far left of the taskbar
- Looking at the grid overlay, I can see the first column (0-99 range)
- The Start button appears in this leftmost section

3. Precise measurements:
- X coordinate: The Start button is in the first grid column, approximately 20 pixels from left edge
- Y coordinate: It's on the taskbar level at Y=1415

4. Visual verification:
- I can see the Chrome icon and other taskbar elements to the right
- The Start button has the typical Windows logo appearance
- Position matches standard Windows UI layout

5. Validation:
- Coordinates are within screen bounds (0-2560, 0-1440)
- Location matches common Windows Start button position
- X value is appropriately small for leftmost taskbar element

The coordinates (20, 1415) represent the standard Windows Start button location at the bottom-left corner of the screen.
