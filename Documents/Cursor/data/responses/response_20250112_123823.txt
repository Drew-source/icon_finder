RESPONSE:
COORDINATES: 1300, 1415
EXPLANATION: To locate the Google Chrome icon, I first focused my search on the taskbar area, which is typically located around Y=1415 based on the coordinate guidelines provided. 

Scanning along the taskbar from left to right, I spotted a circular icon with the distinctive red, yellow, green, and blue segments that match the description of the Chrome icon.

Using the grid overlay, I counted 13 major grid lines from the left edge of the screen to estimate the X-coordinate of the icon center. Each grid line represents 100 pixels, so this puts the X-coordinate at approximately 1300.

For the Y-coordinate, the icon is sitting right on the second grid line up from the bottom of the screen, which corresponds to Y=1400. Estimating the center point of the icon to be slightly below that grid line, I arrived at a Y-coordinate of roughly 1415.

Therefore, my final coordinate estimate for the center of the Google Chrome icon on the taskbar is 1300, 1415. The icon's distinctive color pattern and location on the taskbar give me high confidence this is the correct target.
