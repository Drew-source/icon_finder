RESPONSE:
Based on the image and instructions provided, I believe the Google Chrome icon is located on the taskbar at approximately:

COORDINATES: 1100, 1415

EXPLANATION:
1. The taskbar is typically located at the bottom of the screen, which corresponds to a Y-coordinate around 1415 based on the grid lines.

2. I can see several application icons on the taskbar. The Google Chrome icon, which has a distinctive circular shape with red, yellow, green, and blue segments, appears to be the 4th icon from the left.

3. Counting the grid lines, the 4th icon's center is located around the 1100 X-coordinate.

4. The icon is clearly on the taskbar rather than the desktop or an open window. Its position is consistent with the expected location for frequently used application icons.

5. While I don't have full context on previous clicks, 1100, 1415 fits within the valid coordinate ranges for the taskbar and should center the click on the Chrome icon.

Therefore, clicking at 1100, 1415 should successfully open or switch focus to Google Chrome based on the current screen state. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional instructions!
