# Coordinate Reading Guide

## FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT
- The screen is a coordinate plane with lines every 100 pixels
- X increases left-to-right (0 → 2500)
- Y increases top-to-bottom (0 → 1440)
- The red grid lines are your measurement tools

## PRECISE COORDINATE READING METHOD

### For X coordinates:
- Start from left edge
- Count by hundreds (100, 200, 300...)
- When you reach the section containing your target
- Look at the nearest 100-marker
- Estimate distance as quarters of 100:
  * 25 pixels = quarter grid
  * 50 pixels = half grid
  * 75 pixels = three-quarters grid

### For Y coordinates:
- Same principle but top-to-bottom
- CRUCIAL: Don't measure from 0 if target is closer to 100!
- Example: If something is just below first line (100), it's not "25 from 0" but rather "75"

## COMMON LOCATIONS
- Taskbar: Always Y ≈ 1415
- Top menu items: Usually Y ≈ 75
- Side panel items: Look for nearest hundred, then +/- offset

## VALIDATION METHOD
1. Identify nearest grid lines on both axes
2. Determine if target is before (-) or after (+) those lines
3. Estimate offset in 25-pixel increments
4. Double-check by confirming visible spacing matches your numbers

Remember: Precision isn't about guessing - it's about systematic measurement from known reference points.
